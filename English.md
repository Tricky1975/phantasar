# The Phantasar Chronicles

Hello;

I wanted to introduce myself as the author of the Dutch fantasy sage "The Phantasar Chronicles".
At the moment I wrote this I only have publications in Dutch, but I will soon work hard to be able to publish in English as well.

These books will be there for sale, so this means nothing except these readme files can be found in this repository, and basically all "pull requests" will be denied unless you come up with a spelling fix for either of the readme files.

I'll basically use the issue tracker for "issues" and "reminders". You may also post questions regarding the series.

If your issue is about a book's actual content, please be so kind to prefix your issue's topic name with [SPOILER], as we don't want people to accidentally find out stuff they didn't want to know before they actually had the chance to read about it in the book.

Since the series are initially written in Dutch, I _do_ accept issues written in the Dutch language, and I will even answer them in the Dutch language, however ONLY write your issue in Dutch when you speak about the Dutch versions of the stories. When you speak of the English version (or any other translation in whatever language), please speak English (aside from Dutch I only speak English, so please note that any translation in an other language is done by somebody else).

The kind of stuff you can find here:

- Reminders
  One thing I must do in general or something a (potential) fan requested me to do, but which has to wait until I did other things can be labelled as such.
- Spelling Error / Grammar Error
- NL / EN will be when it handles a specific version of the story. 
- Publication Error
  This can handle font errors, letters too small or big, or some layout issues taken out of its way making the setup ugly and such.
- Physical book
  Just means a book of ink and paper, coming from the press
- E-Book
  And that refers to the E-Book version of the book (epub format mostly)
- PDF
  In some occasions a PDF version of a book may exist.
- Illegal spread
  Is somebody spreading my work without my permission. Well, it will happen anyway, and I don't believe in fighting it, but when you let me know at least, I can at least consider if any action is required.
- Plagiasm
  Is somebody "stealing" my work to get famous or rich behind my back? THEN we got something to talk about. I will not mind fan art (in fact I encourage it) but 'true' copyright violations will require action.
- Fan Stuff
  If you do have fan stuff, by all means, let me know. Maybe you even get a place on my own website.
- Question
- Link me
  Are you a writer, just like me? If you link to me, I will link to you. Just let me know about you. You don't have to release your stuff for free (I don't do that either), but showing a little bit of material so I can get a bit of an image what kind of writer you are, helps me to properly put you on my own website.
- Site
  All issues related to my website http://phantasar.nl (the site has a Dutch and English section)
